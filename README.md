## üì¶ Step 1: Install Required Software

### Install Node.js

Node.js is required to run the application. We need version 18 or higher.

#### Windows:
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the "LTS" version (Long Term Support)
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
4. ‚úÖ Check "Add to PATH" option during installation

#### macOS:
\`\`\`bash
# Option 1: Download from website
# Go to https://nodejs.org/ and download the LTS version

# Option 2: Using Homebrew (if you have it)
brew install node

# Option 3: Using MacPorts
sudo port install nodejs18
\`\`\`

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
\`\`\`bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Node.js 18
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
\`\`\`

#### Linux (Fedora):
\`\`\`bash
# Install Node.js
sudo dnf install nodejs npm

# Or using NodeSource repository
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
sudo dnf install nodejs
\`\`\`

#### Verify Installation:
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
\`\`\`bash
node --version
# Should show: v18.x.x or higher

npm --version
# Should show: 9.x.x or higher
\`\`\`

### Install Git (Optional but Recommended)

Git helps you download and manage the code.

#### Windows:
1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Download Git for Windows
3. Run installer with default settings

#### macOS:
\`\`\`bash
# Usually pre-installed, check with:
git --version

# If not installed:
xcode-select --install
\`\`\`

#### Linux:
\`\`\`bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git

# Fedora
sudo dnf install git

# Arch
sudo pacman -S git
\`\`\`

### Install a Code Editor (Recommended)

While not required to run the app, a code editor helps if you want to customize it.

**VS Code (Recommended):**
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download for your operating system
3. Install with default settings

---

## üì• Step 2: Download the Project

### Method 1: Using Git (Recommended)
\`\`\`bash
# Create a folder for your projects
mkdir ~/Projects
cd ~/Projects

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexus-3d-todo-ai.git

# Enter the project folder
cd nexus-3d-todo-ai
\`\`\`

### Method 2: Download ZIP
1. Go to the GitHub repository page
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location
5. Open terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder

\`\`\`bash
# Make sure you're in the project folder
cd nexus-3d-todo-ai

# Install all required packages
npm install
\`\`\`

**What's happening?**
- npm (Node Package Manager) reads the `package.json` file
- It downloads all required libraries and tools
- This might take 2-5 minutes depending on your internet speed
- You'll see a progress bar and lots of text - this is normal!

**Expected output:**
\`\`\`bash
added 1247 packages, and audited 1248 packages in 2m

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Command not found: npm"
**Solution:** Node.js is not installed or not in PATH
\`\`\`bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version

# If not found, reinstall Node.js from nodejs.org
# Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation
\`\`\`

#### Issue: "Port 3000 is already in use"
**Solution:** Another application is using port 3000
\`\`\`bash
# Use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3001

# Then visit: http://localhost:3001
\`\`\`

#### Issue: 3D view is not loading
**Solutions:**
1. **Update your graphics drivers**
2. **Enable hardware acceleration in browser:**
   - Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí System ‚Üí "Use hardware acceleration"
   - Firefox: about:config ‚Üí webgl.force-enabled = true
3. **Check WebGL support:** Visit [get.webgl.org](https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/)

#### Issue: Voice control not working
**Solutions:**
1. **Check microphone permissions:**
   - Chrome: Click the microphone icon in address bar
   - Firefox: Click the microphone icon in address bar
2. **Use HTTPS or localhost only** (required for voice features)
3. **Check browser support:** Voice features work best in Chrome

#### Issue: Application is slow
**Solutions:**
1. **Close other browser tabs**
2. **Reduce number of tasks in 3D view**
3. **Disable 3D effects temporarily:**
   \`\`\`bash
   # Add to .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBGL_DEBUG=false
   NEXT_PUBLIC_THREE_DEBUG=false
   \`\`\`

#### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution:** Dependencies not installed properly
\`\`\`bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# On Windows:
rmdir /s node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm install
\`\`\`

### Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for red error messages
   - Copy the error message when asking for help

2. **Create an issue on GitHub:**
   - Include your operating system
   - Include your browser version
   - Include the error message
   - Describe what you were trying to do

3. **Common Error Messages:**
   - `EADDRINUSE`: Port already in use (use different port)
   - `EACCES`: Permission denied (run as administrator/sudo)
   - `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`: Missing dependencies (run npm install)
