## Vision and design

The app aims to blend productivity with immersive interaction. The glass UI reduces visual noise while preserving depth and clarity. The 3D interface offers a tactile sense of space, making task boards feel tangible. AI adds a practical layer of intelligence, guiding you toward better planning without overwhelming you. Real-time collaboration brings teams together in a shared space, and strong encryption protects your data.

Key design goals:
- Clarity: Information is easy to read at all sizes.
- Focus: The layout helps users concentrate on the task at hand.
- Consistency: Interactions feel the same across devices.
- Accessibility: People with different abilities can use the app effectively.
- Security: Data stays protected from the moment you start.

---

## How it works

- The front end is built with React and TypeScript, rendering a 3D scene via Three.js.
- The UI uses glass-inspired panels that float over a soft backdrop, with smooth transitions between views.
- Voice commands are processed locally where possible, or via a secure cloud model, to interpret intents like "Add task to today" or "Move task up."
- Gestures are captured through pointer events and mapped to tasks and lists within the 3D space.
- Real-time collaboration uses a lightweight signaling protocol and a synchronization mechanism to merge changes without conflicts.
- Data is encrypted in the browser before it is sent to the server, and decryption happens on the client side when you access your data.

---
